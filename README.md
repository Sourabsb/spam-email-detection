# 📧 Spam Email Detection using NLP & Machine Learning

This notebook-based project demonstrates how to detect spam emails using Natural Language Processing and classic Machine Learning algorithms.

> 💡 Built entirely in a Jupyter Notebook using `email.csv` as the dataset.

## 🔍 What’s Inside

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of spam vs. ham messages
- Data cleaning and duplicate removal
- Feature engineering: character count, word count, sentence count
- Text preprocessing using NLTK (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
- Label encoding (Spam = 0, Ham = 1)
- Vectorization using **CountVectorizer** and **TF-IDF**
- Model training with:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest
  - Decision Trees
  - Naive Bayes
  - AdaBoost, Bagging, Gradient Boosting
- Model comparison using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab  
2. Make sure `email.csv` is present in the same directory  
3. Run the notebook cells step-by-step  
4. You'll see preprocessing, training, and evaluation all inside one file
